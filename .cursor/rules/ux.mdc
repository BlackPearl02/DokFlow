# UX Rules

## Design Philosophy

1. **Professional, not generic AI template**
   - Avoid overused gradients, excessive shadows, or "startup" clichés
   - Use subtle animations, not flashy effects
   - Typography and spacing create hierarchy, not decoration

2. **Dark mode is first-class**
   - All components work perfectly in dark mode
   - Test both light and dark themes
   - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

3. **Micro-interactions matter**
   - Hover states on interactive elements
   - Loading states for async operations
   - Smooth page transitions (not jarring)
   - Button press feedback

4. **Accessibility is non-negotiable**
   - Semantic HTML (use `<button>`, not `<div>`)
   - ARIA labels where needed
   - Keyboard navigation works everywhere
   - Focus states are visible

5. **Performance = UX**
   - Images optimized (WebP/AVIF)
   - Code splitting for routes
   - Lazy load below-the-fold content
   - Fast Time to Interactive (< 3s)

## Component Guidelines

- Buttons: Clear hierarchy (primary, secondary, ghost)
- Forms: Inline validation, clear error messages
- Cards: Subtle hover effects, not overwhelming
- Navigation: Clear active states, breadcrumbs where needed

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Buttons that look like links (or vice versa)
- Forms without validation feedback
- Loading spinners that never stop
- Modals without escape key support
- Infinite scroll without pagination option
